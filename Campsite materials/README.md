This is where we store all of our templates and promotional materials.
Please feel free to use these assets to promote Free Code Camp or your city's campsite. 

If you need some guidance on how to contribute, please follow the [instructions at the wiki](https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wiki/Wiki#contribution-guides) as they are very similar, and hit [@hallaathrad](https://gitter.im/Hallaathrad) if you have any questions afterward.

Though these assets are Creative Commons licensed, we're trademarking the name "Free Code Camp" itself to prevent scammers from trying to impersonate our organization. If you have questions about this, email us and we'll reply promptly: team at freecodecamp com.
